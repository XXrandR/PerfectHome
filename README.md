## Features of the launcher

- 1. Drag and drop: Users can drag and drop icons or widgets to rearrange their positions on the screen. This can be done by using the onTouchListener and onDragListener to detect touch and drag events, and by updating the position of the dragged item in the grid layout.

- 2. Long press: Users can long press on an icon or widget to enter an edit mode where they can resize, remove, or move the item. This can be done by displaying a context menu or a dialog box with different options for the selected item.

- 3. Swipe: Users can swipe left or right to move to different screens or pages on the front page. This can be done by using a ViewPager or a RecyclerView with horizontal scrolling to display multiple screens.

- 4. Pinch and zoom: Users can pinch and zoom on the screen to adjust the size of the icons or widgets. This can be done by using the onTouchListener to detect pinch and zoom gestures, and by updating the size of the selected item in the grid layout.

- 5. Add button: Users can tap on an add button to add a new widget or icon to the screen. This can be done by displaying a dialog box or a list of available items to choose from.
